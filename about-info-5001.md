## Information Systems Program

Northeastern University’s Master of Science in Information Systems (MSIS) program, offered through the College of Engineering, is designed to bridge the gap between business management, software engineering, and information technology. The program emphasizes creative problem-solving, enabling students to design innovative software solutions that address complex business and societal challenges. Students can tailor their studies through various focus areas, including user experience, big data systems and analytics, smart contracts, and intelligent systems. The curriculum combines rigorous academics with experiential learning opportunities, such as co-op programs with industry leaders like Google, Amazon, and Tesla .

## Info 5001 – Application Modeling and Design

INFO 5001 focuses on practicing socio-technical software engineering methods and tools to solve real-world problems. The course explores innovative design and programming techniques to build significant business applications quickly. Students study the process of systematically combining user experience (UX) techniques, business processes, and complex data models to assemble applications that are user-friendly and meet business requirements. The course employs the object-oriented paradigm, visual user interface design principles, and programming languages such as Java, as well as productivity tools, to develop complex, powerful business applications. Students also learn to read and write to standard input/output, use operators, control the flow of execution, use functions, read and write files, and understand basic object-oriented programming concepts.

## Development Tools and Environment

Students in INFO 5001 work with industry-standard development tools to prepare them for professional software development:

- **Visual Studio Code**: Primary integrated development environment (IDE) with extensions for Java development
- **Java (Amazon Corretto 17)**: Core programming language and runtime environment
- **Git**: Version control system for tracking code changes and collaboration
- **GitHub**: Cloud-based hosting service for Git repositories and collaborative coding
- **GitHub Classroom**: Platform for distributing assignments and managing submissions
- **GitHub Copilot**: AI pair programming assistant to accelerate learning and productivity

This professional toolset not only supports course assignments but also provides students with valuable experience using the same technologies employed by software development teams in industry settings.
