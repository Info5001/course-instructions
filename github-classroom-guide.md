## Best Practices for GitHub Classroom 🌟

### Do's ✅

- **Commit Frequently** 🕒: Make small, frequent commits with clear messages
- **Keep Your Repository Clean** 🧹: Don't commit unnecessary files like compiled binaries
- **Read Assignment Instructions Carefully** 📖: Check the README.md file for requirements
- **Start Early** ⏰: Don't wait until the last minute to begin assignments
- **Ask for Help** 🙋‍♂️: Use class discussions to ask questions if you're stuck

### Don'ts ❌

- **Don't Share Your Repository**: Your assignment repo should remain private

- **Don't Ignore Automated Feedback**: Check for automated tests and fix failures
- **Don't Commit Credentials**: Never push API keys or passwords to GitHub
- **Don't Make a Single Giant Commit**: Break your work into logical, smaller commits

## Troubleshooting GitHub Classroom

### Common Issues and Solutions

- **Authentication Failed**:

  - Use a personal access token instead of password
  - Create one at GitHub > Settings > Developer Settings > Personal Access Tokens

- **Cannot Push Changes**:

  - Ensure you've committed your changes first
  - Check if you have write access to the repository
  - Try `git pull` first to sync with remote changes

- **Assignment Link Not Working**:

  - Make sure you're logged into GitHub
  - Check if the assignment deadline has passed
  - Contact your instructor for help

- **Repository Not Showing in VS Code**:
  - Try refreshing the GitHub Classroom extension
  - Clone the repository manually using the terminal
